                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> Silver dashed through the snow-powdered wood, chasing down
prey so she might feed her hungry children.<br>
                  <br><i>How old was I when I first read this book?</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> I'm looking at a picture book about a wolf who takes in abandoned human
children, giving a kind of home to the otherwise helpless creatures. I loved it
as a child, and found myself reading it over and over again.<br>
                  <br><i>Why am I reading this book now?</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> The wolf's skills grew sharper with age. Her eyes were ice, her claws razors.
The rocky, snowy terrain posed no hazard for her, and within moments, she had a
single rabbit wedged between her teeth.<br>
                  <br><i>Where does this book take place?</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> Though the wolf was powerful, she was also kind. In the beginning, it troubled
her how the children wailed without pause and refused the meat she provided,
but her spirit never broke. She began to skin the rabbits, cutting their flesh
into tiny pieces before chewing it and presenting the results to her changeling
pups. And after some time, human and animal slowly came to understand one another.<br>
                  <br><i>That's what this picture book was about.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> I keep reading the book, but still don't understand what's going on. Then a
voice from behind me, sudden. I begin to turn around, hoping to find the
source, when it dawns on me:<br>
                  <br><i>Oh. Right. I'm dreaming.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> My mother had departed the world when I was young, but at this moment, she's talking
to me. Looking at me with her soft, kind eyes.<br>
                  <br><i>That's right. We read it together.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br><i>Why did it take me so long to realize this was a dream?</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> At the end of this book, humans kill the wolf in an attempt to protect the
children. The same creatures who abandoned their own offspring in the woods
hunt down and kill the beast that attempts to care for them. They hold the
children at bay as they reach for her, and sing praises for justice as they slaughter
the passive animal.<br>
                  <br> This part always bothered me when I was young. I'd been unable to accept it, and
remember asking my mother why the wolf didn't fight back when she had been in the
right. "I suppose that's just how mothers are,” she replied after a moment
of thought. I didn't understand back then — in fact, her response made me
angry. But when my mother saw my reaction, she only smiled.<br>
                  <br> I have been dreaming.<br>
                  <br> I have been dreaming of memories long past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-3"> I am dreaming.<br>
                  <br> I am dreaming of the day my mother and my younger self were reading a book
together, and my heart quivers as I see her for the first time in many, many
years. <br>
                  <br><i>No, that's not true. I kept her picture with me — the old news clipping that
reported the queen's death.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> When I was exiled, I had no time to gather photographs or keepsakes — there was
time only to run. But I happened across the clipping while making my escape and
snatched it up, and it has never left my side since. <br>
                  <br> The woman in the photograph, however, is not the mother I knew so well. I do
not see her gentle smile or her kind eyes — I see only the regality of a queen.
Yet even knowing this — and knowing I am in a dream — I desire to speak with
her above all else. But despite my fervent wish, my mother's face shifts like smoke
in the dusk, and the closer I tried to study her, the hazier her visage
becomes.<br>
                  <br> The next thing I know, I am standing in a different place: a hallway filled
with the acrid tang of metal and cordite.<br>
                  <br> There is something strange about the way I am viewing the world, and after a
moment I realize my eye level is different than it had been. I am taller now,
viewing a memory of a different time.<br>
                  <br> I look around and take in my surroundings. Before me stands a great window
filled with massive panes of glass; beyond are row upon row of guns belonging
to the clockwork soldiers. They resemble human arms, and the way they are spaced
equally apart disturbs me in a way I cannot easily explain.<br>
                  <br> Beside me, another figure observes the laboratory. It is none other than my
father — the king of our country.<br>
                  <br><i>Ah. I see now. This is the day we visited the clockwork laboratory.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> One after the other, the metal arms let fly a bullet. Each time, the
researchers write something down, fiddle with this or that, then reload and
repeat the experiment. It is what my father calls "fire-control systems research,”
and I find it equal parts fascinating and horrifying.<br>
                  <br><i>I spent more time with Father after Mother passed. I wonder what he had
thought about that?</i>
                  <br>
                  <br> My father was never much of a talker, but I don't recall him uttering a single
word about my mother's death. The question of why this is sits quietly in my
mind as we stand in the laboratory, but eventually I find myself inquiring
about another matter:<br>
                  <br> "Why did we start conducting research into clockwork soldiers,
Father?"<br>
                  <br> I don't really care about this matter. I just want to talk about something, <i>anything</i>.
I want to hear my father speak, because if he does, maybe it will lessen the
gnawing fear of him that sits eternally in my heart. But his answer only stokes
the flame of my disconcert:<br>
                  <br> "One's superiors do not often give their answers,” he says.<br> "I am a superior to all — including you — yet one day this crown will lie
upon your brow. Perhaps I will hear your thoughts of this matter at some
point.” <br>
                  <br> Without waiting for a reply, my father turns on a heel and departs. <br>
                  <br> But can I follow him?<br>
                  <br> Do I even have the right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-4"> I dreamt of my past: memories of my mother, recollections of
my father.<br>
                  <br> Rarely did I dream after I left on my journey; days of my childhood, images
that paid me a visit for the first time in many years, were enough to fill me
with nostalgia. The sensation was so powerful, the time back then so different from
now, that it almost caused me to raise whines of misery.<br>
                  <br> I wondered if what my mother said to me back then was true.<br>
                  <br> I wondered what my father was thinking about when he spoke to me that day.<br>
                  <br> As the questions from my dream arose, the sight before me warped once again. Heaven
and earth flipped; light and shadow melded.<br>
                  <br> Would these be memories of another time?<br>
                  <br> The next thing I know, I'm standing in a run-down shack. Before me I see
someone's back, one I am familiar with. I know right away what this is — I am in
the process of repairing his clockwork body.<br>
                  <br> “I am sorry, my prince.”<br> There is a slight crackle to the voice I hear from over his shoulder — dust
must have gotten into his sound box. <br>
                  <br> But it's my fault that he was injured. My symptoms had gotten worse, and he had
taken a blow meant for me instead. I couldn't fault him for that. I tell him
that I should be the one apologizing, but he shoots me down. He is so kind to
me, and that's why... <br>
                  <br> ...That's why I'd been wondering this whole time if I'm just a burden to him.<br>
                  <br> He supports me, and so is doing all he can to help stop the war. He is
powerful, yet gentle — I always wonder if there had been a different, more
effective path that he could take to make my vision a reality. <br>
                  <br> All I can do for him is repair his clockwork mechanisms. And if I were ever to
teach someone else how to do it, then he would have no more use for me. <br>
                  <br> The unease bubbles within me and I give it voice: "Should you really be
accompanying me on my journey, for the sake of my dreams?"<br><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]-->
                  <br><!--[endif]--> He falls silent, shocked. Terrified of the quiet, I
immediately apologize, but the silence still hangs heavy over us. <br>
                  <br> He says nothing. Nervous, I lean over and peer at him... to find that his eyes
had gone dark and still, his operations ceased. <br>
                  <br> My unusual question had caused an error in his operations that day. <br>
                  <br> I reprimanded myself: I shouldn't bring these sort of things up during repairs,
and frantically returned to my work. <br>
                  <br> And so, I never heard what his answer had been to my question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

important to me. And yet, why do I dream of such things <i>now</i>?<br>
                  <br> Pain steals my consciousness, wiping away my thoughts. The sights before me
slowly fade away. Now I understand: I'm waking up.<br>
                  <br> I slowly lift my eyelids, but can no longer I sit up. In fact, I can scarcely
move. The pain is a weight that shackles me to this place. I had forgotten all
about these things in my dreams: the ruined church, the illness that prevents
me from moving. Ah, if only it <i>was</i> a dream.<br>
                  <br> Though my eyes can barely focus, I see a figure move. The brim of his hat is
wide and round, and he peers at me with worry. It is clear he has been watching
over me even as I dreamed. I want to speak to him, but my strained throat can
produce nothing but a harsh rasp. It seems our days of long, fulfilling chats
are now over.<br><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]-->
                  <br><!--[endif]--> As I tense, he lifts me into his arms and sets me down atop
an old, weathered pew. My body relaxes as I sink into it. It's much easier to breathe
here than when I'm leaning against the wall, and I'm so relaxed I have trouble
keeping myself awake. Yet despite my newfound ease, I am still unable to
produce any kind of sound.<br>
                  <br> Suddenly, a thought enters my mind, as true thing as I have ever experienced:
If I close my eyes now, they will never open again. And so I muster all of my
strength to force out a sound. I have to speak to him. I <i>must</i>.<br>
                  <br> He has traveled with me across land and time. <br>
                  <br> He is my best friend.<br>
                  <br> And this is the end.<br>
                  <br> "Thank you"<br>
                  <br> "I'm sorry."<br>
                  <br> At last, I manage four meager words. He initially tries stop me as I
desperately reach for my voice, but then falls into silent thought. Finally,
after a long pause, he says:<br>
                  <br> "――――――――――――――"<br>
                  <br> Alas, my ears can no longer hear his words. But strangely, I know his message
regardless.<br>
                  <br><i>Thank you,</i> I say to myself. <i>Thank you</i> I say, repeating the words
over and over in my mind like a mantra until sleep finally steals up and claims
me.<br>
                  <br> In the end, my dreams never came true; I was not powerful enough to end our
endless wars. And yet, there were people who stood by my ideals. Not many, of
course, but some of them eventually agreed to form a third party that could act
as mediators for various warring nations. They were small in scope, and it
would be a long while before they had the pull to bring negotiations to other countries.
But I had lit the spark. And hopefully, that spark would one day burn brighter
than any fire of war and bring peace to the world.<br>
                  <br> I want to believe this. For the sake of all those days I spent traveling with
him, I want to believe it more than anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                  <br> He was born the eldest son and first prince of a royal family. When he was
young, his father started a war, but he was a kind boy who found this hard to
accept. I hear he wanted to preserve peace for the people, so he turned his
back on his country. Isn't it nice he got to choose a life for himself? <br>
                  <br> Sadly, he took after his sickly mother. His physical condition — coupled with
his kind, pacifist disposition — made him unpopular with ministers, soldiers,
and his own father. Even the citizens occasionally besmirched him, asking him
to stop blindly believing in the good of people's hearts.<br>
                  <br> But even with all that, Mama thinks his thoughts and words saved a great many
people. If he ever became king... No. It's <i>because</i> he never became a
king that he was who he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;

are to even draw breath, for the burden birth places on the body has claimed
countless lives. Yet she understood this, which is why she gave me the throne

kindness. Of all us brothers, I am the only one with a different mother. Though

easier for you. I'm sorry this is all I can do, but I really hope it helps.<br>

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> Glasses clink. Men guffaw. The saloon is filled with
chatter, and lively as always. As I attempt to finish my drink in peace, a man
who's so drunk he can barely hold up his head suddenly takes notice of me.
"Hey! Hey, she's here! It's the one-armed woman!"
At his words, the doors fling wide and spill forth a group
of familiar men.&nbsp;<i>Oh joy,</i>&nbsp;I think.&nbsp;<i>The collectors are
back.</i> "Hey there, sweet thing! We haven't got your payment
this week. Maybe we'll just take one of your legs instead."
The lively saloon suddenly becomes silent, as if someone
threw a damp blanket over the rowdy denizens. "Sorry," I say, my
words slurred. "I'll pay at the end of the week."
The collectors scoff. "And how's the great
kingdom-hunter gonna do that, huh? You know that horror show you call a body
ain't no good for manual labor." <i>The kingdom.</i>&nbsp;They were the ones who put my home
to the torch and turned my sister into a killing machine before deciding she
was a failure and cutting her down. Twenty years ago that was, and I'd spent
the long years in between killing every last soldier I could find. I'd been
good at my job — maybe even too good, because these days I don't find anyone
who claims to have been part of that army.
You think I'd be happy to have done such a thorough job, but
I don't feel happiness anymore. I also don't feel satisfaction, or excitement,
or joy. All I feel is an emptiness so deep it threatens to consume me every
time I open my eyes in the morning. The only thing that drives me now is this
saloon and the mind-numbing cure that awaits inside. If I have money, I drink.
If I don't, I work. If I can't find work, I use my left arm as collateral and
borrow — the same left arm that once cut through so many soldiers of the former
kingdom.
"Try speakin' up for once!" growls one of the
collectors as he grabs me by the collar and lifts me off my feet. The sudden
movement causes the drink I was raising to my mouth to reverse course and
splatter all over his arm — a development he doesn't exactly take in stride.
"Damn fool! I'll kill you!"
He throws me aside, grabs a short metal rod from his belt,
and begins slamming it into my side. I drop to the floor and curl into a ball
as he keeps raining blows down upon me. If I had my left arm — and my wits — I
could handle this wretch with ease. But in my current state, I'm a miserably
weak and powerless thing.
"Please... I'll...pay back..."
I'm begging now, which some dark corner of my mind finds
amusing. Despite my hollow days being filled with nothing but drink and
self-loathing, I'm somehow still afraid to die. Life really is a comedy.
"That's enough."
The words come from a man in a cloak who is standing in the
doorway. The setting sun behind him makes it impossible to see his face, but
his voice stirs something deep in my chest.
"Mind your business," spits my assailant.
"This ain't got nothing to do with — "
The cloaked man is a blur. One moment he's standing in the
doorway, and the next he's holding a knife against the collector's throat.
"I said, that's enough."
The collector's breath catches in fear. Unwilling to push
the issue further, he lowers his weapon and slinks out of the saloon with his
metaphorical tail tucked.
"You good?" asks my rescuer. He extends a hand
down to help me up, and recognition suddenly floods over me. I know this man — and
this is the second time he has saved my life.
The first time we met was the night my sister and I became
orphans. We were so cold and tired and so,&nbsp;<i>so</i>&nbsp;afraid, but he
extended his hand to us and asked the same simple question: "You
good?" From that day on, he taught me everything I needed to survive, from
preparing game for eating to wheedling things from adults.
"Been looking for you," he says.
Me? He's been looking for me? Why the hell would he do that?
I'm a drunk, a useless lump with nothing to live for but lacks the guts to die.
And yet, apparently my mentor decided I meant enough to track across all the
miles and all the years.
"Why?" I manage to say.
"Got a request. Hear me out?"
At that moment, I realize this is my last chance. If I let
it go — if I tell him no and turn back to the bottle — I won't last another
week.
"Sure," I finally reply. "Let's hear it.
And...thanks."
It's a lousy reply, but the best I can do at the moment. And
as I say it, I feel a tiny little something in my soul: A spark of hope that
maybe, just maybe, my life is going to change for the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                  <br>"Hang on," I say to the man as we walk. "I
know this road."&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"'Course you do. Bastards took up residence in our old
home."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
                  <br>The reality of this hits me like a cannonball. I remember
these trees — how my sister and I used to run through them without a care. I
haven't been here in at least 20 years; maybe that's why the soldiers decided
to hole up here.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"How's the new arm?"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>I know he's changing the subject to lighten the mood, so I
go ahead and play along. "Better than the last time I pawned it. Broker
did a good job fixing it up."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>The man bought my arm back as payment for my taking the job.
And now that it's a part of me again, the old bloodlust that came with it has
returned as well. But as I turn it this way and that, my companion suddenly
looks over at a nearby thicket.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Come on out," he says in a voice casual as a
spring day.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Sensing an enemy, I raise my sword above my head and grit my
teeth. This time, every last whisper of the kingdom will perish. This time, all
of them will fall. This time —&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"GYaHAhahAHAHahaHA!"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>What leaps out at me is another modified human soldier with
prosthetic limbs — someone just like me.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"It'S BIg siS! EVEryONe, cOOoooOoMe!!"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>On this signal, prosthetic soldiers swarm like insects. I
feel a gorge rising in my throat as they approach. My sword wavers. But it
isn't fear that does this. Oh no. Fear would be easy.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>All of them look exactly like my little sister.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>The creatures don't share my hesitation, and the first one
who reaches me kicks my leg out from under me, sending me crashing to the
ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"WheEhhEEE hEeEE HEEeE! ThiS Is FUn! THIs feeLS
GOOd!"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>She leaps on top of me and makes to plunge her sword into my
chest, but I manage to knock her aside. As she tumbles, a small picture locket
snaps away from her neck and sails into the sky.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br><i>She was once a girl. A normal girl with a normal life.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Come on!" yells the man as he pulls me to my
feet. "RUN!"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>We race into the forest, speeding through the trees I once
loved so much. When the giggling of the soldiers finally fades, we lean against
a pair of tall oaks and try to catch our breath.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Lost 'em," says the man as he places a comforting
hand on my shoulder. At his touch, I realize my entire body is trembling. I can
tell he thinks it's because they looked like my sister, but he's wrong. That's
not the reason I'm trembling at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>I'm just happy they're still alive.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>After losing my little sister, I lived only to destroy the
kingdom — and the day I thought that mission was over, my life lost all
meaning. Yet because I wasn't strong enough to choose death, my life took on a
weird sort of limbo, one where I woke up, drank myself into oblivion, then
repeated the process all over again. But now? Facing the kingdom again after so
very long? I feel...excited. My anger toward the kingdom is what kept me alive
all these long years, my life bound to the object of my loathing.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>And I hate myself for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Hey," says the man. "I know you think you
can only live for revenge, but don't think that. It's too sad. Hell, I'm sure
the life you're looking for is out there somewhere."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>His kind voice is a gentle warmth on my scars, and my small
hand fits inside his gnarled one as if it was meant to be there. "I'll
help you when this is over, all right? We'll find a new way of life.
Together."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>When was the last time I felt such warmth?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>I want to tell him now — tell him&nbsp;<i>everything</i>.
Because the walls I've spent so long constructing around my heart have finally
begun to fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-4"> Having accepted my one-time benefactor’s request, I accompanied him to my hometown — a place where former kingdom soldiers were said to be hiding. Though I had twinges of doubt in my heart, I ignored them so I might bring his wish to life:<br>
                  <br><i>I want to save my beloved, who was kidnapped by men from what remains of the kingdom.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>We snuck toward town, deftly avoiding the soldiers who patrolled the area. But once inside, I could hardly believe my eyes. The town was brightly decorated as if for a festival — and amidst the glitter and pomp, augmented soldiers went about their regular lives.<br>
                  <br>"WhAT aN AusPICIouS DaY!<br>WHat AN auSPIcioUS daY!"<br>
                  <br>Perhaps it’s fairer to say they were&nbsp;<i>trying</i>&nbsp;to live regular lives. Some were giving morning greetings. Some were cleaning. Some were eating. But their every movement was stiff and unnatural, like old toys in need of repair.<br>
                  <br>"The hell is going on here?"<br>
                  <br>I did not mean to speak the words aloud, but the sight so shocked me that they simply slipped out. The moment my breath became sound, the augmented soldiers turned as one to look at me.<br>
                  <br>"KIlL! KIlL! I wAnT to KiLL!"<br>
                  <br>They swarmed like insects, and I barely managed to protect my companion from the initial assault.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"We’re getting out of here NOW!" I cried, shoving him back. I didn’t want to lose anyone important to me ever again — I&nbsp;<i>couldn’t</i>. But then an electric shock coursed through my whole body, sending me crashing to the ground.<br>
                  <br>"Seize her, but do not harm her."<br>
                  <br>Just before my world faded to black, I realized the person giving the orders was the very same man I had been trying to protect.<br>
                  <br>* * * * *<br>
                  <br>"Ah, good. You’re awake."<br>
                  <br>The man’s voice pulled me from my unnatural sleep. I tried to move and couldn’t, and quickly realized one of the soldiers was holding me in place.<br>
                  <br>"Are my toys not adorable? Ah, I tried to get them to act human, but it didn’t work out quite as I planned."<br>
                  <br>His expression was bright, his voice as gentle as ever. It only made the experience all the more uncanny.<br>
                  <br>"Why!?" I cried. "Why are you working with the kingdom!?"<br>
                  <br>"Oh, there’s no need to worry about&nbsp;<i>that</i>," he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. "The kingdom is gone — consigned to the dustbin of history. All I did was borrow a bit of their technology regarding human augmentation."<br>
                  <br>He pulled out a locket and opened it, staring spellbound at the photo inside. "Do you recall my wife?" he murmured, almost to himself.Memories of a more peaceful time flooded over me. Though older than me, his wife was a tiny waif of a thing who resembled a little girl more than a woman grown.<br>
                  <br>"We ran when the kingdom attacked, but our journey only led to a different kind of hell."<br>
                  <br>He stopped his story, pulled a newspaper clipping from his pocket, and tossed it at my feet. The headline read: ROYAL MILITARY EXPANSION CAUSES CHEMICAL POLLUTION.<br>
                  <br>"The rot started in her lungs before spreading to the rest of her body. It was fast—<i>so</i>&nbsp;fast. Like a wind. The doctors had no idea how to help her, but rather than surrendering hope, I decided to replace her failing body with that of a machine."<br>
                  <br>"You wanted to augment your own&nbsp;<i>wife</i>!?"<br>
                  <br>"Yes. And if you wish to know how it ended, you need only remember the thing that jumped you in the forest."<br>
                  <br>At that moment, I realized the face in his locket was the same as the soldier I encountered in the woods. Even though the kingdom itself was gone, its horrid technology lived on to birth new pain — and those who weren’t compatible with augmentation inevitably lost all control of themselves.<br>
                  <br>"Ah, yes," he said in response to the horror that moved across my face. "I fear she’s been like that ever since the operation. I needed to know if there was a way to get her back, so I kidnapped people and experimented on them to further my research."<br>
                  <br>The soldiers I had seen in the forest? The people I’d seen in the town? All victims of his cruel work.<br>
                  <br>"Alas, I could never get the results I wanted. But then I found&nbsp;<i>you</i>."<br>
                  <br>Me — someone who survived the operation. Even though I was deemed a failure, I still retained a sense of self.<br>
                  <br>"I wanted you to see the pain of those who do not have the sweet release of death. With you helping me, I can&nbsp;<i>end</i>&nbsp;that! My research will grow by leaps and bounds!" A flame lit in his eyes then, one stoked by madness. "You endured the augmentation, so give me your mind! Give me your body! Do so for the sake of my wife, as well as for all who suffer in agony and pain!"<br>
                  <br>He had come down a road from which he could not turn back, all for the sake of one he loved. It was a truth I knew painfully well.<br>
                  <br>Which is why I could not permit him to continue.<br>
                  <br>I shook off the soldier holding me and readied myself for battle. This nightmare would end today.

                  <br>"AAaaAAHh Ha HA hA ha HA!<br>LEt'S dANce, sIs!"<br>
                  <br>I didn't want to hurt the augmented soldiers more than he already had, so instead I damaged their machine parts, rendering them inoperable.<br>
                  <br>"Animal! You would destroy the fruits of my research!?"<br>
                  <br>Realizing the tide had turned, he tried to slip away through crowds of augmented soldiers. But I saw right through his ruse and chased him down.<br>
                  <br>"The kingdom's technology dies with you." I said as I stood over him, sword at the ready.<br>
                  <br>"No, wait! This is good for you, I swear! I'm going to help you find a new way of life, just as I promised!"<br>
                  <br>I could tell he was trying to curry favor, but instead of rage, the attempt created only a kind of emptiness inside me.<br>
                  <br>"You think having me aid your experiments is a new life?"<br>
                  <br>"Yes! You can&nbsp;<i>help</i>&nbsp;people! You can finally be a savior, not a murderer!"<br>
                  <br>Oh, but he knew how to spin a pretty tale. Yet I was viscerally aware of how his technology brought about only misfortune and misery.<br>
                  <br>"I bet she would be happy if you helped!" he continued frantically. "Your sister―"<br>
                  <br>He spoke my sister's name.<br>
                  <br>"You..."<br>
                  <br>The tip of my blade shuddered.<br>
                  <br>I saw a distant past, then. Beheld forgotten memories — memories of the only time in my life that could hope to soothe me. And he destroyed them. He used my sister's name for his own ends.<br>
                  <br>"All I want is to perfect the technology!"<br>
                  <br>As my memory fell apart, I destroyed him.<br>
                  <br>"That's a shame."<br>
                  <br>There was a flash as my blade struck flesh. Silence descended over the area. It was over quickly — far too quickly.<br>
                  <br><i>Enough is enough.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>I had my revenge, and lost my life's meaning in the process. I know now that my days would run into each other one after the next, turning into a meaningless, insubstantial blur I could never escape.<br>
                  <br>"Time to join her."<br>
                  <br>The ending of my own life would snuff out any lingering existence of the kingdom. I brought the blade to my chest, felt the pressure. But the moment I began to push, a soft thud from somewhere beyond the trees brought me to a halt. If there were augmented soldiers left, I had a duty to dispatch them quickly and painlessly. But as I approached the sound...<br>
                  <br>"Who are you?" asked a little girl who could be no more than 10. "What are you doing here?"<br>
                  <br>"Me? I, uh... What are&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;doing here?"<br>
                  <br>"I live here with Papa and—&nbsp;<i>cough, cough</i>!" The hand to her mouth turned pale red. "Sorry. I can't stop coughing. Mama was like that too."<br>
                  <br>"What happened to your mom?" I asked.<br>
                  <br>Her eyes clouded. "Mama...stopped being Mama. But Papa's trying to fix her."<br>
                  <br>"Is he now?"<br>
                  <br>"Yes! And once Mama's fixed, he's gonna fix me, too!"<br>
                  <br>The man had expressed his wish to save his beloved. That, at least, had not been a lie.<br>
                  <br>"But Papa's been so busy with research that he...forgot me."<br>
                  <br>It all started with a wish to save his wife, all well as his daughter. It started with a desire to keep his family safe. What did he say in the end?<br>
                  <br><i>I want to perfect the technology.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>The poor fool was so caught up in the journey that he forgot the destination.<br>
                  <br>"Have you seen my papa?"<br>
                  <br>There was only one thing to do. I can't say it was the correct thing, or that I even had the right to do it in the first place. But...<br>
                  <br>"Your papa went on a journey. He's trying to find a way to save you. You can stay with me until he comes back."<br>
                  <br><i>I must be at her side.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>"Aw! I wanted to wave bye."<br>
                  <br>The girl took my hand with her own. It was soft and warm as the sun.<br>
                  <br>"He didn't want to see you sad," I whispered.<br>
                  <br>"Papa's so nice," she said with a smile. As she did, I felt the evening breeze slowly push aside whatever remained of my hesitation.

                  <br>She said Mom taught her a lot about how to cook food! I want Mom to teach me too so I am going to be on my best behavior all the time!<br>
                  <br>So I helped clean up too! My sister made a big mess while cooking, so the whole house was a mess! It was funny.<br>
                  <br>By the way the neighborhood dog went missing so we are all going to go looking for him.<br>
                  <br>Maybe he just wants to play hide and seek?

The animal — which had been rushing at the speed of an arrow not moments earlier — crumples to the earth before the man. When that happens, a small girl less than half his size peeks out from behind a tree, her eyes glittering in wonder.<br>
                  <br>"Footprints in mud. Broken branches. The forest leaves many clues for us to find."<br>
                  <br>The man does not know how to be a father; all he can teach her is hunting and survival. Though he knows logically that teaching a woman such skills will only make her life difficult in this day and age, it remains all he can do for her. But his daughter is blissfully unaware of his worries; she is only delighted to watch his gallantry.<br>
                  <br>Soon, the man will be drafted and sent to war. He must return alive, lest his family starve. This fears kick the cogs of his mind into gear, and he shakes his head to clear his musings.<br>
                  <br>"While I am away, you must look after your mother and the new baby. Understand?"<br>
                  <br>His words are casual, the meaning behind them lost on the little girl. But in her eyes, she clearly realizes this is what a family protector should look like.<br>
                  <br>"I will come back to you," he says as he enfolds the girl in his massive arms.<br>

                  <br>And yes, it is perhaps idealistic and naive for a ruler to speak of such things, but the more you listen to her, the more it sounds like an achievable reality. The beautiful country in her mind is precious to me, and I want to see the notion become real. But more than that, I want to be at her side on the day she achieves it, because the hours she spent telling me of her ideal future have been some of the finest of my life.<br>
                  <br>But I know. I know that in order to achieve her dream, we will have to, at times, resort to methods she hates. Physical force. Violence. ...Or worse.<br>
                  <br>A King's Memoir, Part 1<br>
                  <br>Our kingdom had always been adept at creating intricate clockwork mechanisms, with a skill in the art far surpassing that of any neighboring lands. As such, the other countries on the continent considered us to be a great menace.<br>
                  <br>And perhaps they were correct to do so, for a new type of research was taking place within our kingdom — one that would secure us an endless supply of soldiers. Throwing all of our money, power, and effort into the task, our country soon found favorable results, and the soldiers were brought to life more quickly than even the most optimistic projections.<br>
                  <br>Our new creation was the ultimate soldier: a creature made of steel and wire that would never tire, and with a mind capable of calculating at impossibly fast speeds. The lead researcher, who called his creation "clockwork people," explained that having passed basic performance tests, they would now enter the final stage of testing before sending them into the field.<br>
                  <br>"I appreciate you taking the time to come out all this way, Your Majesty," said the lead researcher as he gestured to a line of clockwork people on the other side of the window.<br>
                  <br>They looked more human than the last time I came to observe the work. And yet, despite their familiar bodies, their eyes were empty⁠; they seemed less like they were standing of their own free will and more that they could do nothing else.<br>
                  <br>"We have come to the conclusion," continued the researcher, "that in order for clockwork people to operate in an optimal manner, we must integrate into their thought processes four laws. And today, I would like to demonstrate for you a test of these laws."<br>
                  <br>The researcher's fingers flew over the device in his hand. A moment later, the room went dark, and an image was projected onto the wall. It was a bit difficult to make out, but through the shadows and gloom I could see a mass of people heading into a village. Some were the clockwork people, but a number were our own human soldiers—I even recognized a few of their number.<br>
                  <br>"This is a live feed of a unit presently en route to the stronghold of some bandits," said the researcher. He went on to explain that the test was for the clockwork people to protect the senior officer leading the arrest operation.<br>
                  <br>The bandit stronghold looked like any other house in the city. But when the unit marched in — their footsteps rough and heavy in the moonless dark — they caught the bandits off-guard and captured them without incident. It was an impressive display, one so good I failed to hide my glee.<br>
                  <br>"I see Your Majesty is pleased," said the researcher. "And yet, we've something far more impressive in store."<br>
                  <br>As the squad led the captive bandits out of the building, a few more of the ruffians launched a surprise attack. Chaos engulfed the scene⁠, and I saw the superior officer at the front of the fray take a stray bullet and fall. The clockwork people immediately surrounded him, prioritizing his safety above all else.<br>
                  <br>But then I noticed someone strange: one of the clockwork people did not leapt to the officer's defense. Instead, it hurried to the side of a random human soldier and assumed a protective stance.<br>
                  <br>After a bit of a struggle, our unit managed to subdue the bandits, and the video cut out. But all I could think about was the clockwork soldier who had protected the random man — and when I mentioned this to the researcher, I saw a smile appear on his face.<br>
                  <br>"You've a keen eye, Your Majesty. In truth, we had the commanding officer switch uniforms with that man."<br>
                  <br>"Interesting," I replied. "I'd heard the clockwork people automatically confirmed rank by the insignia on a uniform. That alone would be impressive, but this one somehow saw past the insignia and recognized the superior officer."<br>
                  <br>"Your Majesty is indeed correct."<br>
                  <br>"But how?"<br>
                  <br>The researcher explained that the clockwork person in question had been collecting information of its own accord during the mission. It did not rely solely on the intelligence provided before the mission; instead, it continued to observe and arrived at the correct conclusion through a constant updating and verification of information.<br>
                  <br>"To sum up," said the researcher, "we have given the clockwork people small variations to their cogitation. In essence, each one has something of a personality."<br>
                  <br>"And it appears this 'personality' worked in our favor this time," I added.<br>
                  <br>"Indeed, sire. Yet while we have achieved fruitful results, we will make certain not to incorporate any dangerous behaviors to said personalities."<br>
                  <br>As I nodded, another thought occurred to me. "What were you testing in this particular instance, by the way?"<br>
                  <br>"The First Law: A clockwork being must always protect the lives of the royal family or its own commanding officer."<br>
                  <br>He turned to me then and bowed his head slightly, "Now then, Your Majesty, do you have any opinions as to what should be done with this particular unit?"<br>
                  <br>"Keep testing it," I said as I turned to leave. "We can always dispose of the thing later if we need to."

                  <br>Her breathing is pained. Her skin, which once shone like a newly-polished pearl, it is now pale and lifeless. As I stand before her and gaze upon her distended stomach, I cannot contain my anxiety.<br>

                  <br>"Let's think of a name for our child," she says to me in a faint whisper. "We will entrust our baby with the future of this country, so I want to name it together."<br>

                  <br>A King's Memoir: Part 2<br>
                  <br>There came the deafening sound of something large splitting open, followed by a wave of high-pitched, delicate noises. Several clockwork soldiers had obeyed orders and opened fire on a vase of flowers.<br>
                  <br>The kingdom was currently pushing the development of automatons of war. Yet if they were to be the ideal soldiers, we would need to implement in them four distinct laws. The destruction of the flower vase was a test of the second law, one many members of the royal court had watched with great interest.<br>
                  <br>The Second Law: A clockwork being must follow the orders of the royal family or its highest ranking officer.<br>
                  <br>Several soldiers — as well as a common beggar plucked off the street — were shouting commands at the clockwork people. The test was to see if they could pick out the voice of the highest-ranking person and execute that command.<br>
                  <br>The clockwork people stood in a line on the other side of thick, reinforced glass. All wore special earpieces; we were told that was how they heard the cacophony of orders. And when they determined the highest-ranking one — to fire on the flower vase — they did so without hesitation.<br>
                  <br>As the test continued, they fired on a number of different items from among a jumbled mass on a desk.<br>
                  <br>"Let's have them shoot the clock next," said the lead researcher. A moment later, the orders came through both the headsets of the clockwork people and speakers in the room where the royal court was stationed.<br>
                  <br>"The pot!" cried the beggar.<br>
                  <br>"The vase," murmured the soldiers.<br>
                  <br>"The clock," whispered the commanding officer.<br>
                  <br>The clock exploded in a hail of bullets, causing the audience to cheer with delight. After clearing up the mess, the researchers came out of a back room with a number of live rabbits and proceeded to dump them on the ground, where they began hopping about.<br>
                  <br>"Might you order them to kill the rabbits, sire?" said the lead researcher.<br>
                  <br>The voices began anew, order spilling upon order. But when my voice rang out, it was followed by the predictable thunder of gunshots. But something was strange this time: unlike the previous demonstrations, the gunshots were not in unison. Indeed, while all the rabbits now laid dead on the floor, some had been shot multiple times.<br>
                  <br>What could explain this discrepancy? Yes, the rabbits were moving about, but I had been assured the clockwork people had near-perfect accuracy.<br>
                  <br>The head researcher clearly sensed my question, "One of the units feels joy when it kills a living being, sire," he said. "Another is hesitant, while a third makes no distinction between animate and inanimate objects. Basically, the results change depending on their personalities."<br>
                  <br>Ah, yes. The personalities. When I last visited the lab, the researcher informed me that each unit had been given small changes to their cogitation, resulting in what they were terming "personalities."<br>
                  <br>After cleaning away the gore, the scientists brought out a group of monkeys. The head researcher then proceeded to dole out various conflicting orders.<br>
                  <br><i>Bite their ears.</i>
                  <br><i>Soothe them.</i>
                  <br><i>Grab their legs.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>While the clockwork people obeyed, their actions were not anywhere near in unison. And when they were given the final order to kill the monkeys, things diverged even more. Some took their time, enjoying the act of slowly taking a life. Others, however, seemed wracked with guilt, and their hesitation to end a life ended up causing the poor creatures far more suffering than if they had simply been swift and sure with the killing blow. So though the means had been different, the pain experienced by each monkey was ultimately the same.<br>
                  <br>I personally found it fascinating. But the expressions of my fellow royals soon clouded over; they clearly had not expected to see such a gruesome sight. The lead researcher, however, paid no attention to their discomfort, and ordered his subordinates to proceed to the final test.<br>
                  <br>One held with humans.<br>
                  <br>Just as with the monkeys, the lead researcher gave the clockwork people various orders. But this time, their personalities shone through brighter than ever. When they acted against their targets — with their unique hairstyles, face shapes, and clothes — they moved with a grace and skill that belied their mechanical nature. But in the moments where they were&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;exerting power, their movements were awkward and comical.<br>
                  <br>I suddenly understood that was how deadly weapons were meant to be. But I also realized that nothing more could be gained by dragging such a thing out further.<br>
                  <br>"Enough," I said. "End this test."<br>
                  <br>The lead researcher turned to the clockwork people."Kill them," he said.<br>
                  <br>Hearing the order, the crackle of gunfire rang out through the room. One unit, however, did not act. Instead, it simply stood in place, almost as it had been powered off. This was a unit which had obeyed every previous order with a kind of dull, plodding precision—one which I thought might lack a personality altogether.<br>
                  <br>As I shook my head in disappointment at having witnessed our first failure, I heard the sound of a sob and looked over to see a small boy crying.<br>
                  <br>"Ah, most excellent," said the lead researcher.<br>
                  <br>I turned to him, confused, and he continued.<br>
                  <br>"I believe the unit was following a voice not from its earpiece, but from this very room."<br>
                  <br>The crying boy was the heir to one of the country's most prestigious noble families — and upon hearing his distress, the clockwork soldier had stayed his hand.<br>
                  <br>Now that was&nbsp;<i>most</i>&nbsp;impressive.

                  <br>A King's Memoir, Part 3<br>
                  <br>The kingdom's best scientists and most advanced technologies came together during the development of the clockwork people. And as the tests continued — tests to see if they could endure real-world usage — things reached a new and exciting phase.<br>
                  <br>The lead researcher had concluded that four laws needed to be incorporated into the clockwork people's thought processes if they were to operate optimally.<br>
                  <br>The First Law: A clockwork being must always protect the lives of the royal family or of its own commanding officer.<br>
                  <br>The Second Law: A clockwork being must follow the orders of the royal family or of its highest ranking officer.<br>
                  <br>The Third Law: A clockwork being must protect itself, as long as doing so does not contradict the first two laws.<br>
                  <br>Now, the team was finally ready to test both the durability of the clockwork bodies, as well as the Third Law.<br>
                  <br>Thirty clockwork people stood in neat rows in the testing area. Each one had a slight variances in their thought process, a trait that would manifest as a kind of "personality." While this was done in order to produce more accurate reports, it meant each clockwork person would act differently in response to the same order.<br>
                  <br>"Let us begin," said the lead researcher.<br>
                  <br>A large door at the far end of the room rolled back to reveal one of our largest weapons — a thing the size of an elephant that stomped into the room on multiple legs.<br>
                  <br>"This unit has proven to be one of our greatest battlefield successes," said the lead researcher proudly. I knew all about it, of course: it was a crude device that couldn't execute fine maneuvers, but was perfect for situations requiring overwhelming destructive power. It was also the first weapon I'd ordered to be built after ascending the throne.<br>
                  <br>"In this test, we hope to see the clockwork people defeat their foe while protecting themselves in the process. Any units that accomplish this task will be considered our first field-ready clockwork people.<br>
                  <br>"As a buzzer sounded, signaling the beginning of the test, the clockwork people sprang to life before the massive weapon could even respond. They pelted it with gunfire from every direction, but that did little more than scratch its heavy armor plating. After a few seconds of this, they changed course and began focusing their attacks on its joints in an effort to bring it down. But then the weapon unleashed a brilliant beam of white-hot light from its cannons, and attack that sent the clockwork people flying.<br>
                  <br>"It's like watching ants fight a scorpion," I mused.<br>
                  <br>"Precisely," he lead researcher enthused. "But wait."<br>
                  <br>The different personalities of the clockwork people quickly began to emerge. A handful attempted to escape, but were gunned down before they could reach the doors. Some clung desperately to the massive weapon, while others ran in chaotic circles and fired their guns wildly. The weapon kicked and smashed and stamped them in a frenzy, and it seemed only a matter of time before all the clockwork people would be destroyed.<br>
                  <br>There was a clear imbalance of power, and I felt certain the test had entered its final, messiest stage. Irritated, I turned to look at the leader researcher, and was shocked to see him smiling.<br>
                  <br>"Please watch, Your Majesty!"<br>
                  <br>At his prompting, I saw one clockwork person firing at the weapon from behind cover. As I watched, I realized it was not firing indiscriminately, but instead targeting one specific part of its armor.<br>
                  <br>After creating a rather sizeable dent, the unit leapt out from its hiding spot, ducking and weaving through cannon attacks as it approached the weapon. Once there, it reached into the dent and ripped the plating free. Clinging to the weapon itself means there's no possibility of being struck by any of its attacks. The weapon's pilot, realizing their predicament, causes the weapon to move in such a way that the clockwork person would be shaken free, but it quickly leapt back on and peeled away more of the plating.<br>
                  <br>"There is potential here," murmured the researcher.<br>
                  <br>The newly armored clockwork person — the last one standing — ripped off another chunk to reveal the weapon's internal circuitry. If it could break through in that precise spot and tear apart the wiring, there was a chance of victory.<br>
                  <br>But the unit was in a sad state. Despite the armor, it had been thrown to the ground countless times, losing an arm and suffering various other injuries. Before it could reach into the wires, it was thrown free into a pile of its disabled fellows. And as it struggled to pull itself to its feet, the massive weapon stomped over, raised a single leg, and ended the test for good.<br>
                  <br>"A disappointing ending," I said, shaking my head.<br>
                  <br>Having completed its mission, the weapon sat quietly in place, as though awaiting its next orders. The valiant unit that had fought to the end was now buried amidst the husks of its fellow clockwork people, and I could no longer pick it out from among the rest.<br>
                  <br>"However," I added, "that one unit showed promise."<br>
                  <br>The lead researcher nodded in excited agreement.

                  <br>If only the prince had been named not by my late wife, but by me. If we had only named him after our god of war as I desired...then perhaps things would have been different.<br>
                  <br>A King's Memoir, Part 4<br>
                  <br>Metal bodies that do not know exhaustion.<br>Mechanical brains which calculate at impossible speeds.<br><i>This</i>&nbsp;is the new face of the soldier.<br>
                  <br>As our research progressed, tests were carried out in the name of the kingdom's prosperity. We had been calling our new creations "clockwork people" under the assumption they would take on tasks in place of humans. But one day, the lead researcher said something that changed everything:<br>
                  <br>"Your Majesty, I would like you to meet our very first clockwork soldier — the first one to successfully pass all of the tests."<br>
                  <br>Before me knelt a clockwork person — no, a clockwork&nbsp;<i>soldier.</i>&nbsp;Its head was bowed in the manner of a loyal retainer, and I was immediately intrigued; while I had seen many such machines at work in the tests, only a select few had managed to catch my eye.<br>
                  <br>"This unit does not seem familiar to me," I mused. "Which tests did it pass?"<br>
                  <br>"Indeed, Your Majesty," replied the lead researcher eagerly. "This is not a unit you have seen in action. Yet at the same time, one could also say you&nbsp;<i>have.</i>"<br>
                  <br>As I frowned, the lead researcher pointed out the window toward the massive testing area, where clockwork corpses were scattered across the floor like discarded toys.<br>
                  <br>"This unit is the cumulative result of all our tests, physically as well as mentally."<br>
                  <br>The perfect soldier would have a quick mind, a tenacious body, and an unshakeable spirit. And while humans could come close to these ideals, they could never quite achieve them to the utmost. But now, the lead researcher was claiming this new creation has done so.<br>
                  <br>I gazed down at the kneeling clockwork soldier, who remained perfectly still. From all of those clockwork people — all of those sacrifices — this unit had been born.<br>
                  <br>"It was not simply a matter of switching out parts, though," the researcher continued. "We extracted experiences and thought processes from the remaining records in order to optimize this unit's operational circuits."<br>
                  <br>Images of all the units that had acted in bizarre fashions — the ones that left an impression in past tests — flashed through my mind. "Such a combination would certainly make a clockwork soldier that fights like a human. But I thought I made it clear that was not our ultimate goal."<br>
                  <br>What I wanted were beings that did not think, but instead followed orders, doing whatever was necessary to see a task to completion.<br>
                  <br>"As you said, Majesty. Our tests proved the greatest results are obtained from units with the weakest personalities."<br>
                  <br>The lead researcher had once thought instilling human-like emotional variations would lead to the creation of soldiers that could adapt to any environment. It was not an altogether incorrect thought; several of the clockwork people I saw throughout the tests managed to put such personalities to good use. But the clockwork soldiers were weapons — and standardized, practical tools did not require variations.<br>
                  <br>"But this is not to say their personalities were a total waste," continued the researcher. "Their thoughts and experiences played a role in heightening the abilities of the unit before you. Of course, we will ensure it does not manifest as a personality, but as a kind of auxiliary mechanism that helps the unit execute its mission."<br>
                  <br>The researcher wound his way carefully through his words, making them sound less like an explanation and more like an excuse. But I merely nodded, choosing not to question him further. Because even if a personality&nbsp;<i>were</i>&nbsp;to manifest, all we had to do was delete it.<br>
                  <br>"And the fourth law?"<br>
                  <br>"Expunged, Your Majesty."<br>
                  <br>The researcher originally wanted a fourth law: A clockwork being must serve the royal family and its superior officers of its own will. But weapons did not need a will any more than they needed personalities. All they needed to do was take lives without thinking. And now that this unit had been born, we could unleash our weapons to the world.<br>
                  <br>"Raise your head."<br>
                  <br>The clockwork soldier looked up at me as I spoke. Though it was designed to look human, its expression was completely blank, which caused me to smile.&nbsp;<i>This</i>&nbsp;was the face of a killing machine — a heartless creation that would carry out any order without a second thought.<br>
                  <br>I crouched before the unit, took its chin between my fingers, and peered into its glassy eyes. "As our country's first clockwork soldier, I think you are deserving of a name."<br>
                  <br>I smiled as I fell silent. Though I appeared to be deep in thought, I already had a name in mind.<br>
                  <br>"You will fight like a god of war and bring victory to this country. Therefore, your name will be..."

He has been programmed to know and feel all manner of things: fighting styles, battle strategies, and of course, loyalty to the kingdom's rulers. And if I had to guess, I'd say his memories of the time he spent traveling with the prince were also filled with violence. Let's take a little peek, shall we?<br>
                  <br>Oh dear! He's pointing his gun at a woman who spoke to the prince in town! ...Oh, but she was just asking for directions. Hurry away, you poor thing!<br>
                  <br>Oh no! He just shot at something in the trees! Was it an enemy, or an assassin or... Oh. No. Apparently he was just getting some fruit out of the tree for the prince's dinner.<br>
                  <br>And now, in the dark of night, he keeps watch over his charge. Each time the boy turns over, he pulls the blanket back across his thin shoulders. He does this over and over and over again.<br>

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-9"> The boy's cough echoes through the room, his pale breath vanishing into the air of the underground storage area. The clockwork man notes the temperature and realizes it has fallen another degree.<br>
                  <br>"This climate will harm you, My Prince. Allow me to disable my temperature regulators so I might heat the room."<br>
                  <br>At this suggestion, the boy suppresses a cough while holding out one pallid hand.<br>
                  <br>"Just promise you won't destroy yourself trying to help me again."<br>
                  <br>The man, reflected in the boy's clear gray eyes, replies with a hardened voice and blank expression. "Clockwork soldiers do not understand the concept of promises, My Prince. Only orders."<br>
                  <br>The words appear to wound the boy.<br>But the man does not know why, nor does he ask.<br>
                  <br>"But&nbsp;<i>I'll</i>&nbsp;remember," says the boy. "And that's enough."<br>
                  <br>He coughs again and weakly lets his hand sink back down to his side.

                  <br>After arriving at the village, the boy gives the order before stepping inside a small church. The man follows the child's instruction to the letter, waiting patiently near the door. But after a bit, he hears the sound of screams. A moment later, a child runs up and begins desperately tugging on his arm.<br>
                  <br>"Please, sir! Our friend just fell out of a tree! You have to carry him to the doctor!"<br>
                  <br>The child then yanks the man's hand again, pulling him down the road and away from his charge.<br>
                  <br>A short time later, the boy emerges from the church to find the man kneeling in the dust of the road. "I failed to follow your orders and await punishment," he says. "Here is what happened...."<br>
                  <br>The boy listens intently to his story. When he learns the child is safe, he sighs with genuine relief and allows himself the briefest of smiles.<br>
                  <br>"Don't be ridiculous. I'm not going to punish you for&nbsp;<i>that</i>."

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-11"><i>Let us rest.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>The attending man makes this suggestion upon hearing the boy — his master — breathing in harsh, ragged gasps.<br>
                  <br>"No," replies the boy. "We need to hurry on."<br>
                  <br>As they proceed, a pack of overgrown stray dogs suddenly appear to block their way. Though annoying, they are enemies easily failed. But as the fight proceeds, a thought occurs to the man:<br>
                  <br><i>If I were to let myself be injured here,</i>
                  <br><i>my master would surely accept my proposal to rest.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>On the heels of this thought comes a memory — a thing the man recalls someone saying to him. He immediately discards the option of intentional injury and begins dispatching the dogs with calm efficiency.<br>
                  <br>Once the enemy is defeated, the man turns to the boy. "My apologies, but due to exhaustion as a result of that battle, I require rest."<br>
                  <br>At least, the boy nods in agreement.<br>
                  <br>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*<br>
                  <br>After they make camp and the boy drifts off into a fitful sleep, the man minds the fire and thinks about the events of the day. The thought that came to him during the battle was a memory of himself and his master. White breath. Shaking hands. Gray eyes. And these words:<br>
                  <br><i>Promise me you'll never harm yourself for my sake again.</i>
                  <br>
                  <br>Why did he use his own injuries as an excuse to force his master to rest?<br>
                  <br>Why did his promise come to mind in that moment?<br>
                  <br>Why did it cause him to alter his actions?<br>
                  <br>Why did he lie about exhaustion when he was not tired?<br>
                  <br>The flames of the campfire shimmer in his eyes. No matter how many calculations he runs, he can find no answer. Instead, he simply sits back and thinks about the warm emotion rolling about in his chest.

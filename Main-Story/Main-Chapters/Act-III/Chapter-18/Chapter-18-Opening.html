While she may seem to enjoy the very picture of an ideal youth, all that awaits her when she returns home to a rented apartment is her unemployed father, and days of crushing poverty as she struggles to make ends meet. Her mother, whom her father is now divorced from, was an extravagant spender and saddled him with impossible debts that have left him a spiritually broken man.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Caring for her father, she starts cleaning the apartment. Picking a photo off the floor and looking at it, she sees her younger brother, who now lives with their mother. She remembers a time when the family was together. Happy. She crushes the photo in her fist and returns to her father's side. No matter how difficult things get, she will continue to smile for the sake of the father she loves so much.

Her hood pulled over her eyes in an attempt to hide her face, she enters a dingy alleyway away from any main streets. There, she meets her client - a young man of college age. After taking his money, she hands him a small bag containing illegal drugs.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Though it harms her conscience greatly, this is the secret profession she has assumed so she might repay her family's massive debt. All she wants is to live a quiet life with her<br>father, and she will risk everything for this one small wish.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Upon returning home, her father breaks into tears and speaks of the shame he feels at not being able to provide his daughter with the higher education she deserves. As she offers her father words of comfort, cold rage accumulates in her heart as she thinks about the person who shoulders the blame for their terrible misfortune - her mother.

Bearing the weight of her crimes in solitude she continues to go to school as normal, but one day not long before graduation, her school finds out about her secret job. She is berated by her teachers, her offer to join an upstanding company is rescinded, and she has been suspended. All of her hard work has blown away like chaff in the wind, and on top of it all, rumors about what she's done are spreading through the school like wildfire.<br>
                  <br>Having lost everything, she turns her mind over to darkness. What keeps her going in this difficult time is thoughts of her father, who has always been on her side no matter what. Driven by a desire to continue smiling by her father's side, she makes her way home.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>However, what she sees upon returning home is beyond her worst nightmares. The empty shell of her father swings slowly in the gloom - he has taken his own life. Her last ray of sunlight flickers and dies. And as tears begin to form around the corner of her eyes, she finds herself tumbling into an endless dark.

Looking around, she realizes that she is in her home in the real world. Suddenly hearing a familiar voice, she hurries to the entrance and sees her father with a kind smile on his face. And after she does, she cannot help but bury her face in his chest and sob. As her father gently stroked her hair, she surrenders herself to this brief moment of happiness. Having regained a normal life with her father, she enjoys the kind of brilliant youth any high-schooler would aspire to... but it all comes to a sudden end due to the actions of her younger brother.<br>
                  <br>She finally learns the truth: No matter how many times she rewrites the past, her father will always be killed by her brother, and she herself will always kill her mother due to the hatred she holds for her. No matter how much she may pray, she wish to live with her father will never come true. In order to bring about her earnest wish for revenge, she once again makes for The Cage.

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> In the library of a metropolitan high school, a boy is reading over a complicated technical manual. A place apart from the usual bustle of youth, this library is like a sanctuary to him. But unfortunately, on this day, the chatter of other students is an annoyance too great for him to bear, causing him to abandon his study earlier than expected. After getting teased for always being alone, the boy heads to the hospital where his mother is admitted.<br>
                  <br>Naturally frail, his mother lost even the ability to stand due to the abuse she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband - the boy's father. He finds a photograph on the floor of his mother's hospital room. It shows his big sister, who went to live their father, and captures a moment in time when his parents were happy together. The boy now devotes himself to his studies so he might one day save his dear mother, and he doesn't care if he has to walk that path in solitude.

He feels intense stress whenever confronted with the absurdities of modern society, but he does his best all the same. One day, he is called upon by his mother's physician and confronted with a devastating truth: His mother's congenital heart condition has worsened, and she very little time left. The boy pleads with the doctor, insisting there must be some way to save her, and the doctor says a heart transplant is her only hope.<br>
                  <br>There would be many hurdles to overcome, including finding a suitable donor and paying for the costly procedure. Thinking on how it's his father's fault that his mother's life is in danger, he feels a hot rage accumulating in his heart. In his mother's hospital room, the boy agonizes as he holds her hand in his own... but then an idea comes to him. Noticing his own heart beating in his chest, he wonders if he could offer it up to save his mother.

The only thing that keeps him going despite it all is thoughts of his mother, who has always been on his side no matter what. He steels his resolve to sacrifice his own life to save his mother's. He will use poison purchased on a shady website to cause his brain to die while leaving his heart intact for his mother. The boy brings the poison to his mouth, and his final moments feel as though they will last into eternity... but then his phone rings.<br>
                  <br>After rushing to the hospital, he is greeted by the sight of his mother dead in her hospital bed. The boy then remains by her side, weeping at the loss of his last remaining beam of moonlight.

Looking around, he realizes that he is in his home in the real world. Suddenly hearing a familiar voice, he hurries to the entrance and sees his mother with a cheerful smile on her face. Finally seeing his mother well, the boy cannot help but shed tears and wish that this moment of happiness will last forever. His mother released from the hospital and their lives back to normal, the boy gradually starts fitting in more at school... but it all comes to a sudden end due to the actions of his older sister.<br>
                  <br>He finally learns the truth: No matter how many times he rewrites the past, his mother will always be killed by his sister, and he himself will always kill his father due to the hatred he holds for him. No matter how much he resists, he will never save his mother. In order to bring about his earnest wish for revenge, he once again makes for The Cage.

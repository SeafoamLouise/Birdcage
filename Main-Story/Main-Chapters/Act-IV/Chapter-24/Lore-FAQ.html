              <br>Quick disclaimer: there are some answers in this that are interpretive and some that are not due to how much is left open-ended. If it is an interpretive answer, it's specified. The goal of this is to both clear up any lingering thoughts as well as clarify anything you may be confused on, especially given how much was thrown out with the final two chapters, and to also specify what we objectively know as true versus what remains vague. Of course, please do not take this as gospel since again, interpretive answers are interpretive answers. You can interpret things differently, and there may be some random additional small facts said somewhere that I didn't catch while writing this.<br>

                  <br>My interpretation is that it was not possible before in prior games, but is now, and that Fio was able to reincarnate because it was the combined power of Her (who has the power of both the Red Girl / N2 and power of Sleeping Beauty Quantum Server, and Sleeping Beauty is confirmed to be powered by a massive amount of maso) as well as the human data of the Quantum Server of the Moon (which required time to evolve enough to see other branches and potentially Accord providing weapons that it could extract the stories of).&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Essentially, this interpretation is that the reincarnation was possible because of the work of the original humans, maso from Angelus, power from the machine lifeforms (and by proxy aliens), and power from androids all combining together into one miracle, and only with all that is it able to happen.

Its relevance to this game are that it's common theorized that Her freezing time could be the Falldown, or a timeline where humans have no chance of surviving causes the Falldown, where a branch will then be sealed and moved onto another to try and find one where humans do survive. In that sense, the theory is that this ending means that the Falldown has either been worked past with unfreezing time or outright prevented and no longer a thread since Fio is proof that humanity can revive.&nbsp;<br>

Friend eventually ends up choosing her own will to depart and see the world, so 10H gives Friend a matching form and all of 10H's memories, while 10H stays behind to keep the mini-Cage intact so that Friend can even exist, and Friend manages to escape and reach Mama. Friend isn't 10H, but she can be interpreted as a separate entity, copy, reincarnation, etc. of 10H that is able to have a happy ending. It is implied by 10H's fourth hidden story ending that the original 10H data is still within The Cage and is still waiting for somebody to help her, but as Friend did find Mama and wanted to save 10H, there is still a possibility that the original 10H is rescued one day.</p>

They are an endless amount of branches and possible outcomes of the world, and each story in the game is what really did happen in those branches. The Cage acts as both simulating those branches and being records of them. For example, this would mean that while the original Fio of her branch died from starvation in the ruins, a copy of her data in The Cage ended up being who we watch over who ends up being the one to reincarnate. Another example would be that in the branch the game takes place in, Yuzuki and Hina both die during the wars on the Legion, but the ones in The Cage come from a branch where the Queen Beast never attacked. Both events did happen, but in different branches.</p>

According to interviews, the anime was in pre-production before the announcement of the remaster as well as <span style="font-style: italic;">NieR Re[in]carnation</span>. The remaster's Ending E and the novella The Lost World Appendix ver.1.22... both focus on Him and Her, with the novella also outlining His final thoughts before dying, talking about creating Her, and describing Him seeing structures that sound similar to The Cage. It is likely that based on this, the plot of this game was planned ahead of the remaster and anime.

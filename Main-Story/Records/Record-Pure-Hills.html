                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> A small, remote village sits nestled in the face of a steep cliff. And in it, there once lived<br>a young girl. She always sulked as she watched the village children playing outside her window. She wasn't sick. Instead, she had a mark on her leg that made her different. Her parents told her to hide the mark. If she did not, they would not allow her to go outside. But the mark was a part of her. Each time they told her to hide it, it was like they were asking her to deny her very being.<br>
                  <br>The girl hated the thought of hiding it, and the more they told her to, the harder she resisted. She and her parents had been having this fight for several long years now...

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-3"> The girl was locked in her house so others would not see the mark on her leg. Unable to contain her discontent, she decided to disobey her parents and sneak out of the house.<br>
                  <br>She ran through the village like hell itself was pursuing her, but when she crested a hill, she found someone was already waiting there. It was a warrior with flowing white hair. She sat quietly on a boulder, her swords stuck into the ground nearby. Her pale skin was crisscrossed with wounds, as though she had just finished a battle. But it was the warrior's left side that truly drew the girl's attention. It was covered by bandages that had slipped to expose a patch of inky black skin. Skin that looked like a larger version of her own birthmark. <i>She's just like me</i>, thought the girl. Suddenly, she felt a deep ache to be like this woman, a person who did not even flinch when someone stared at her mark. "I want to be like you," said the girl. As the woman turned to look at the girl, her gaze fell on her leg. A curious mixture of sadness and anger flitted across her face like a wraith in the dark.<br>
                  <br>"There's nothing good in a life like mine."<br>This said, the warrior turned away from the girl as if she had never noticed her in the first place. She then tightened her bandages and walked away.

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-4"> After parting ways with the warrior on the hill, the girl returned home. As she made her way to her parents' room to tell them what happened, she heard whispered voices from the other side of the door.<br>
                  <br>"We've caused her so much pain by telling her to hide her birthmark like that."<br>"But we did it for the right reasons. You know what would happen if people saw that and thought she was possessed!"<br>
                  <br><i>My parents are actually worried about me.</i>
                  <br>"Possessed." When she heard that word, the girl recalled a conversation she had with her parents when she was but a child.<br>
                  <br>It was a story of a warrior who had been cursed by a Shade and turned into a monster. And about how horribly she had been treated in this very village. The girl remembered the mixed emotions on the face of the woman she met earlier. She had lived through things the girl could not even imagine. Feeling ashamed for imposing her own desires on the warrior, she began to think about the hidden meaning behind the woman's expression.

                <p class="u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-5"> To the girl, the mark on her leg was a part of her. And her parents accepted that. But if the other villagers saw it, terrible things would surely come to pass. And not just to her, but to her parents as well. Caught between her parents' love and her own pride, the girl was in anguish.<br>
                  <br>Soon thereafter, she began hiding her mark. In so doing, she hoped to acknowledge the love her parents had blessed her with. But though she disguised her birthmark with bandages, she refused to hide the wrapped leg. In this way, she hoped to mirror the pride of the warrior. The girl stands at the top of the hill, bathed in sunlight. Looking out, she makes a firm resolution: Once she is as strong as the warrior... Once her parents no longer have to fear for her safety... She will remove her bandages and walk the world as she was meant to. As the girl gazes over the plains, reflected in those eyes is the sky that leads to her future.

His clever ministers took care of the day-to-day affairs, so all the king had to do was sit on the throne and smile. Still, he had three wishes he wanted to come true.<br> ───────────────<br>The first of his wishes was to grow up quickly. He'd always felt powerless because of his youth, and wanted to become an adult so both his own people and other countries might acknowledge him as a leader of worth.<br> ───────────────<br>His second wish was to create a country where his people always felt safe. His beloved father, the late king, had shared this dream, and he was determined to make it happen.<br> ───────────────<br>His last wish was to kill all of his ministers, who had murdered his father for their own gain. He smiled as he thought about this — and about how he would make the wish come true the moment was grown.

Violating a law would result in harsh punishments or even death, but most citizens still praised them.<br> ───────────────<br>The first law was "Do not steal." This obviously included theft and burglary, but also life—and once there was even a dispute as to whether "stealing one's heart" counted.<br> ───────────────<br>The second law was "Do not harm another's reputation." Though it seemed a kindly law, it was actually enacted to avoid damaging the dignity of the kingdom through language or insult.<br> ───────────────<br>The third law was a secret, which the people loved, for they felt it made everyone more considerate. Alas, no one realized it was done simply so the royal family could execute whomever they wished.

Life with my dearest family was stolen from me, but in return I was granted a royal existence in a prospering nation.<br> ───────────────<br>Months later, I stole away with food and money and secretly returned to my family — but all I found in my house were rotting corpses. Enraged, I returned and pressed the king for answers.<br> ───────────────<br>The king informed me he had my family killed to keep my work as his double a secret — at which point I grabbed a spear and plunged it into his face. "Now I am king!" I cried as the deed was done.<br> ───────────────<br>The next day, I went to the throne room to find the king alive and well. So did I kill the double? No, I am the double!

But the prince returned the gift, saying to the knight, "You deserve a long life. Not I."<br> ───────────────<br>Not long after, the knight died in battle. As his consciousness faded into the long dark, he realized the stuffed bird was<br>nothingmore than a pretty decoration.<br> ───────────────<br>Years passed. The prince became king and a fine leader, and the stuffed bird sat in his chambers. Whenever he looked at it, the kind knight came to life in his heart, and thus was he immortal after all.
